DynamicHeads → ClassicHeads Converter
-
DynamicHeads → ClassicHeads Converter is a system that automatically replaces Roblox's DynamicHeads to the legacy ClassicFaces. The system will automatically detect which dynamic head you are using and replace it with the classic face counterpart.

Installation
-
Install/Copy the latest version, put 'ConversionServer' into ServerScriptService, and 'StaticHeadTable' into ReplicatedStorage. (legacy versions may be unstable, but are archived for any reason you might need.)

FAQ
-
Q: Does it work with R6 and R15?

A: Yes, this script works for either body type.

Q: If I’m using a UGC face, what will it do?

A: The script will detect that you are wearing a dynamic head, but it will not take any action unless it is toggled to replace it with the default smile.

Q: Do I need to credit you for using this?

A: No! I don’t mind this being used without credit, I’ll appreciate it if you do credit me, but you don’t have to.

Q: This script doesn’t work for a certain head, how would I report this?

A: You can reply to this post, Roblox was inconsistent with how they made their DynamicHeads, and it would take me way too long to test every head. I tested 15 heads and 13/15 worked. (I patched the other ones)

Q: Will this be maintained when they do new changes to DynamicHeads?

A: Yes, I will try my best to continue maintaining & updating this as much as possible. I will also make sure to release small patches in case some faces don’t work still.
